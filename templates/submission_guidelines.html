<h1>Test Server Input Guidelines</h1>


<h2>Example Input JSON</h2>
<pre>
    {
    "---0tKA3iYI": [0, 201, 36, 87, 0, 0, 0, 631, 0, 0],
    "--Gscx86GA0": [45, 550, 610, 0, 0],
    "--KXjWTy7Yw": [0, 0, 0, 75, 0, 0, 136, 0, 0, 0, 259]
    }
</pre>

<p>In this example, we have three video IDs with their corresponding lists of timestamps.</p>
<ul>
    <li>Video ID "---0tKA3iYI" has timestamps: [196, 456, 34, 105, 721, 82]</li>
    <li>Video ID "--Gscx86GA0" has timestamps: [0, 295, 509, 143, 612]</li>
    <li>Video ID "--KXjWTy7Yw" has timestamps: [200, 48, 831, 630, 402]</li>
</ul>

<p>Please ensure that your JSON input follows the same format when making requests to the test server.</p>



<h2>Input</h2>

<p>
We provide a list of test videos, along with their activity label and candidate steps.
 You can find the input file <a href="example_input_file.html">here</a>.
The video IDs are the original YouTube IDs used in HowTo100M.
For each step, we provide the 'step_headline' and 'step_paragraph' entries, which can be used to ground the step.
</p>


<p>The test server accepts JSON input containing video IDs as keys and lists of single timestamps as values.</p>
<p>The timestamps in the JSON represent your model's predictions for grounding
     the step at the corredponsing index in the list. The order of the steps aligns with the provided input file, 
     which lists the candidate steps for each test video.
    </p>

  Predictions for the non-alignable steps are ignored.
